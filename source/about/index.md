Hello there. I would like to take a minute to explain why I started this blog. 

I have been working as a web developer last five years and learned a lot of interesting things in that time.
But more impotently I also forgot a bunch of them.

So I heard somewhere that a good way remember things is to write them down. So I decided to write them down here, so I may easily find them when needed. And if someone else finds them useful, great.

Also I was always just awful at writing. So this my be a good way to improve that. 

If you have any questions you can use the comments below or use any contact methods in the profile.
Hope you enjoy this blog and find something you like :)
