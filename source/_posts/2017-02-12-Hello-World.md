Hello world from my new blog.
This is my first blog post ever and I would like to use it to explain why I started this blog.

<!-- more -->

I have been working as a developer last five years and learned a lot of interesting things in that time. But more importantly I also forgot a bunch of them. That includes lots of technical manuals, tutorials and interesting concepts. 

So I heard somewhere that a good way remember things is to write them down. So I decided to create this blog and write them down here, so I may easily find them when needed. And if someone else finds them useful, even better. I have always been able to find a lot of useful information on other peoples blogs, and this is my small way of returning the favor.

Also I was always just awful at writing. So this my be a good way to improve that.
And if you see any mistakes, you can always issue a Pull Request in the [Github repo](https://github.com/Predjo/blog/tree/master/source/_posts).

If you have any questions you can use the comments below or use any contact methods in the profile.
Hope you enjoy this blog and find something you like :)
